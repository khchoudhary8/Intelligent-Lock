We have made an Arduino fingerprint-based door lock with a wireless attendance record directly available in its custom-made app. It serves its purpose as a security management system. This project makes a room / gate secured until a registered fingerprint is entered to unlock it, it also records the attendance of the particular person on that particular date and shares it wirelessly to an app made in Android studio specially for this purpose. This project also uses leds and buzzer for audio and visual engagement. The app facilitates ease of access for the admin to check the attendance log. This security system aims to make doorways more secure and find its application with various enhancements on a wider scale such as a home door lock or an entry door lock and attendance system of a school or a company.
